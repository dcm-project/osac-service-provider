# Design Decisions: OSAC Service Provider

This document records architectural and design decisions for the OSAC
Service Provider, referenced by ID (`DD-NNN`) from the specs in
`.ai/specs/`. New decisions are appended here as implementation surfaces
them, so this file stays open across milestones rather than being tied to
any single spec document's lifecycle.

**Related Specs:** `.ai/specs/osac-sp.spec.md` (Milestone 1)

## DD-010: One health endpoint per registered provider, not a single unified path

**Decision:** Serve health at `GET /api/v1alpha1/clusters/health` and
`GET /api/v1alpha1/vms/health` — one path per independently-registered
provider (Topic 4.4) — rather than a single unified
`GET /api/v1alpha1/health`. Both paths report identical status, since this
SP's OIDC/OSAC health is one global condition.

**Rationale (superseding the original decision in this slot, which was
wrong):** `environment-agent`'s own detailed spec
(`.ai/specs/environment-agent.spec.md`) is explicit and concrete about how
health polling addresses a registered SP — `AC-HMN-010`: *"Given an external
SP is registered with endpoint `https://sp.example.com:8080`... When the
health check polls `GET https://sp.example.com:8080/health`"* — i.e. the
agent polls **`{registered endpoint}/health`**, literally appending `/health`
to whatever `endpoint` value the SP registered. This is reinforced by
`REQ-RTE-040` in the same spec: *"the agent MUST forward creation requests
via `POST {endpoint}`"* with no additional path segments added by the agent
— which only works if `endpoint` is already the full resource-collection
URL. Since Topic 4.4 (REQ-REG-030) registers `cluster` at
`{provider.endpoint}/api/v1alpha1/clusters` and `vm` at
`{provider.endpoint}/api/v1alpha1/vms`, applying `{endpoint}/health`
per-registration yields `/api/v1alpha1/clusters/health` and
`/api/v1alpha1/vms/health` — not a third, unrelated unified path. This also
matches the real, shipped convention in every sibling SP checked
(`k8s-container-service-provider` → `/api/v1alpha1/containers/health`,
`acm-cluster-service-provider` → `/api/v1alpha1/clusters/health`,
`k8s-storage-service-provider` → `/api/v1alpha1/volumes/health`,
`three-tier-app-demo-service-provider` → `/api/v1alpha1/three-tier-apps/health`):
health always nests under the SP's own registered resource path, never a
bare top-level path.

The original version of this decision cited issue #1's REST API contract
table for a single `/api/v1alpha1/health` path without verifying it against
`environment-agent`'s actual polling contract — a hallucination corrected
here before implementation.

**Phase 1 (`control-plane`) confirmation:** unlike the `environment-agent`
citations above (which were spec-only, since that project's own health
checker is unimplemented), `control-plane`'s health-check monitor is real,
running code, and confirms the identical convention directly:
`internal/sp/healthcheck/monitor.go`'s `performHealthCheck` builds
`strings.TrimRight(provider.Endpoint, "/") + "/health"` — the same
`{registered endpoint}/health` construction, appended per-`Provider`-row.
This decision needed no change for the Phase 1 pivot (DD-050); if anything,
it is now verified against running code rather than an unimplemented spec.

## DD-020: Minimal `Capabilities`-only gRPC client for Milestone 1

**Decision:** This milestone generates (via `buf`) only the
`osac.public.v1.Capabilities` client — the smallest, explicitly
unauthenticated proto service — to back the connectivity probe. The full
`Clusters`/`ComputeInstances`/`Subnets`/`VirtualNetworks` stub generation
pipeline is Milestone 2's deliverable per issue #1's suggested milestones.

**Rationale:** Issue #1 places "gRPC client generation" in Milestone 2, but
also requires Milestone 1's health check to report "real OSAC gRPC
connectivity" — these two constraints are reconciled by scoping Milestone
1's codegen to the one service that (a) requires no auth per its own proto
comment ("This endpoint does not require authentication") and (b) is
purpose-built for capability/connectivity discovery, making it accidentally
the ideal minimal probe target. The `buf.gen.yaml`/`buf.yaml` files
introduced here are extended, not replaced, in Milestone 2.

**Related requirements:** REQ-OSAC-080, REQ-OSAC-090

---

## DD-030: Health response schema

**Decision:** Health response uses `status: "healthy"` or `status:
"unhealthy"` with fields `type`, `path`, `version`, `uptime`, matching the
schema convention already used by sibling SPs' health endpoints, plus an
optional `detail` field for this SP's two-part health condition (token +
connectivity).

**Rationale:** Consistency with the DCM three-state health model
([enhancements#47](https://github.com/dcm-project/enhancements/pull/47)) and
with how sibling SPs shape their health payloads, while accommodating that
this SP's health depends on two independent external systems (Keycloak,
OSAC fulfillment service) rather than one (a local Kubernetes API server).

**Related requirements:** REQ-HLT-020, REQ-HLT-030, REQ-HLT-070

---

## DD-040: Registration retry independence for `cluster` vs. `vm`

**Decision:** Implement the two registrations as fully independent
goroutines/retry loops, not a single loop iterating over two service types.

**Rationale (updated for Phase 1/`control-plane` — see DD-050):** originally
justified by `environment-agent`'s `vm`-registration `409`/slot-contention
scenario (kept not fatal, retried on the lease-renewal cadence) needing to
coexist with `cluster` succeeding independently. That specific scenario no
longer applies (see DD-050) — `control-plane` has no per-service-type
slot contention. The decision itself still holds on general grounds: any
independent, non-transient failure on one service type's registration (a
validation bug in the `vm` metadata payload, a `control-plane`-side outage
affecting only one in-flight request, etc.) must not block, delay, or leak
backoff/failure state into the other's retry loop (REQ-REG-060). Sharing a
retry loop would couple that state unnecessarily.

**Related requirements:** REQ-REG-060, REQ-REG-090

---

## DD-050: Two-phase registration target — `control-plane` for Phase 1, `environment-agent` deferred to Phase 2

**Decision (supersedes the original single-phase decision in this slot):**
OSAC SP's first release (Phase 1, this milestone) registers with
[`dcm-project/control-plane`](https://github.com/dcm-project/control-plane)'s
SP API (`POST /api/v1alpha1/providers`, per
`api/sp/v1alpha1/provider/openapi.yaml`), using its generated
`github.com/dcm-project/control-plane/pkg/sp/client/provider`, pinned by
commit SHA (no tagged releases exist for `control-plane` either). Migration
to `dcm-project/environment-agent` (the originally chosen target) is
deferred to a future Phase 2, once that project reaches sufficient maturity.
This reverses the direction taken during the original enhancement review —
tracked for the enhancement doc update in
[enhancements#95](https://github.com/dcm-project/enhancements/issues/95).

**Rationale — maturity comparison (why the reversal):** at
`control-plane`@[`6c16c06`](https://github.com/dcm-project/control-plane/commit/6c16c0654018cd779a7c3ad8739427644732c41b),
`POST /api/v1alpha1/providers` is a **complete, wired** implementation —
`internal/sp/handlers/provider/handler.go` implements the generated
`StrictServerInterface` end-to-end (List/Create/Get/Apply/Delete) against a
real store, mounted in `internal/app/run.go`. `environment-agent`'s
equivalent handler, by contrast, exists only as generated stubs
(`server.gen.go`) with no `internal/handlers`/`internal/service`
implementation and a no-op `main()` — unchanged from the original writeup of
this decision. Neither project has tagged releases, but `control-plane`'s SP
registration path is functionally complete today; `environment-agent`'s is
not. `k8s-container`, `acm-cluster`, and `kubevirt` already register
directly with `control-plane` (via the archived `service-provider-manager`
client rather than `control-plane`'s newer `pkg/sp/client/provider`) — OSAC
SP now targets the same backend as its siblings for Phase 1, rather than
diverging from them, and is the first SP to exercise the newer client.

**Authentication:** `control-plane`'s SP registration and CRUD-dispatch APIs
(`api/sp/v1alpha1/provider/openapi.yaml`,
`api/sp/v1alpha1/resource_manager/openapi.yaml`) declare
`security: [bearerAuth: []]`, enforced by in-app JWT bearer validation
([`internal/auth`](https://github.com/dcm-project/control-plane/blob/main/internal/auth),
added in
[`control-plane#24`](https://github.com/dcm-project/control-plane/pull/24)
as part of the
[authentication enhancement](https://github.com/dcm-project/enhancements/blob/main/enhancements/authentication/authentication.md)).
That check is currently a no-op: `AUTH_DISABLED` defaults to `true`
([`internal/app/config.go`](https://github.com/dcm-project/control-plane/blob/main/internal/app/config.go)),
and `control-plane`'s own outbound call to the SP's endpoint sets no
`Authorization` header either. Sending no bearer credential from this SP
(REQ-REG-115) is therefore correct behavior today, but is a **known,
tracked gap, not a permanent architectural guarantee** — see the
Authentication Gap paragraph below.

**Authentication Gap (open, not scheduled):** the authentication
enhancement documents `AUTH_DISABLED=true` as a transitional mitigation and
states it "must not be used in production deployments." The ticket meant to
give SPs a real, authenticated path to `control-plane` —
[FLPATH-4196](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4196) and its
enhancement-doc story
[FLPATH-4455](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4455) — was closed
Won't-Do ("will be handled in the agents epic as the architecture has
changed"). The successor,
[FLPATH-4622](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4622), has not
started and is blocked on the Phase 2 `environment-agent` implementation
itself
([FLPATH-4486](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4486)). So Phase 1
currently has **no active, unblocked implementation path** to
production-safe authentication against `control-plane` — closing this gap
may require the Phase 2 migration this decision already defers to. Treat
this as a Phase 1 production blocker to track, not a cosmetic doc gap;
re-evaluate the Phase 2 migration trigger (maturity bar, above) if it
remains unaddressed by the time this SP approaches a production rollout.
Full writeup: [enhancements#96](https://github.com/dcm-project/enhancements/pull/96)
("Authentication" and "Risks and Mitigations" sections).

**This is not just a client-library swap — `control-plane`'s CRUD-dispatch
model differs materially from `environment-agent`'s, which matters for
future milestones even though it doesn't block this one:**
`control-plane`'s `internal/sp/service/resource_manager.InstanceService`
dispatches **synchronously over plain REST** directly to
`provider.Endpoint` (`POST {endpoint}?id={instanceId}` with body
`{"spec": {...}}`; `DELETE {endpoint}/{instanceId}`) — looked up from the
same `Provider` row `POST /providers` writes — rather than
`environment-agent`'s CloudEvent-through-a-messaging-topic model with a
DCM-generated `resourceId` forwarded in the event body. Milestone 1 (this
spec) only covers registration and health, so this doesn't change anything
implemented here, but it means Milestone 2+'s CRUD/idempotent-creation
design (currently written against the CloudEvent model elsewhere in the
enhancement doc) will need real rework, not a find-replace, when that work
starts — tracked as open questions in enhancements#95, not resolved here.

**Confirmed favorably while researching this update:** `control-plane` has
its own real health-check poller,
`internal/sp/healthcheck.Monitor` (see the Phase 1 confirmation added to
DD-010) — it polls `GET {provider.Endpoint}/health` on an interval and
expects exactly the `{"status": "healthy"|"unhealthy"}` body this SP already
implements (Topic 4.3), escalating to its own `Unavailable` state via
consecutive-failure counting rather than reading a three-state body from the
SP. **No change was needed to Topic 4.3's design or its already-implemented
health handler for this pivot** — DD-010's two-endpoint-per-provider decision
holds, now confirmed against running code instead of an unimplemented spec.

**Lease/TTL consequence:** `control-plane`'s `Provider` row (see
`internal/sp/store/model/provider.go`) has no lease/TTL/expiry field — a
registered entry persists until explicitly deleted; health is tracked
independently by the monitor above via `ConsecutiveFailures`, not by
whether the SP keeps re-registering. This removes the "the SP loses its slot
if it stops renewing" mechanic entirely, which is why the pre-pivot design's
"409 is retryable, retry on the lease-renewal cadence" behavior was replaced
by REQ-REG-090's non-retryable handling rather than adapted — see DD-040.

**Maturity risk (still accepted, now against a different target):**
`control-plane` also has no tagged releases, so the Go dependency MUST still
be pinned to a specific commit SHA and bumped deliberately, not tracked via
`@latest` or a floating branch. Milestone 1's registration integration tests
(Topic 4, `osac-sp-integration.test-plan.md` §3) exercise a **fake HTTP
server implementing `control-plane`'s current OpenAPI contract**, not a live
`control-plane` instance — consistent with the existing test-design
philosophy (a fake was always the plan; only what it fakes has changed).

**Schema consequence (unchanged by the pivot):** `control-plane`'s generated
`Provider`/`ProviderMetadata` struct has no `supported_platforms`/
`supported_provisioning_types`/`kubernetes_supported_versions` fields either
— these OSAC-specific values MUST be carried as additional keys inside
`metadata` (`ProviderMetadata`'s `additionalProperties: true` catch-all,
which flattens to sibling JSON keys alongside `region_code`/`zone`/`status`/
`resources` on marshal). See REQ-REG-040.

## DD-060: Resolve the OIDC token endpoint via discovery, not by treating the issuer URL as the token endpoint

**Decision:** Before requesting an access token, the SP MUST perform
discovery — trying `GET {oidcIssuerUrl}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
(RFC 8414) first, then falling back to
`GET {oidcIssuerUrl}/.well-known/openid-configuration` (OpenID Connect
Discovery 1.0) only if the first request fails — and use the `token_endpoint`
from whichever document was successfully retrieved for the client-credentials
grant. `oidcIssuerUrl` MUST NOT be passed directly as the OAuth2 `TokenURL`,
and discovery MUST NOT be narrowed to only one of the two well-known
documents.

**Rationale:** An OIDC *issuer* URL (e.g.
`https://keycloak.example.com/realms/osac`) and its *token endpoint* (e.g.
`https://keycloak.example.com/realms/osac/protocol/openid-connect/token`) are
different URLs in every real deployment; treating them as interchangeable
was a hallucination in the original implementation, caught by the same
"verify against an authoritative source" review that caught DD-010/SC-001.

The *first* corrected implementation (this decision's original text) only
queried `.well-known/openid-configuration` — itself a second, more subtle
hallucination, caught by the same review pass while independently verifying
the vendored `authn_capabilities_type.proto` (DD-020): that proto's own
doc comment on `trusted_token_issuers` documents discovery via
`.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and cites RFC 8414, not OpenID
Connect Discovery. Tracing this to the ecosystem's actual client code
confirms which pattern applies to *this* SP's flow specifically:
- `osac-project/fulfillment-service`'s own `internal/oauth.TokenSource` —
  the thing that authenticates `fulfillment-service`'s **own**
  client-credentials grants (`CredentialsFlow`) against the same class of
  Keycloak issuer this SP authenticates against — calls
  `DiscoveryTool.Discover()`, which tries `oauth-authorization-server`
  first and falls back to `openid-configuration` second
  (`internal/oauth/oauth_discovery_tool.go`). This is the correct thing to
  mirror: same grant type, same issuer, same authoritative project.
- `osac-project/osac-ux`'s `proxy/auth/oidc.go` queries only
  `openid-configuration`, with no RFC 8414 attempt — but it backs a
  *human* browser authorization-code login flow, not client-credentials.
  Citing it as precedent for this SP's machine-to-machine flow (as the
  original version of this decision did) was itself a category error:
  superficially similar code, wrong flow to mirror.
- `dcm-project/control-plane` depends on `github.com/coreos/go-oidc/v3`
  for OIDC concerns elsewhere in the DCM ecosystem; that library's own
  provider discovery also tries `oauth-authorization-server` before falling
  back to `openid-configuration`, consistent with `fulfillment-service`'s
  behavior.

**Consequence:** the OIDC bootstrap can no longer build a static
`clientcredentials.Config` at construction time (`New()`); discovery must
happen lazily, inside the same retryable/non-blocking loop as token fetch
(REQ-OSAC-060), since either discovery document may be transiently
unreachable at startup just like the token endpoint itself. Discovery logic
must attempt both well-known paths, in order, before treating discovery as
failed for that attempt.

## DD-070: Error `type` URIs use RFC 9457 with project-controlled URIs, not bare short codes

**Decision:** `Error.type` values are full, project-controlled URIs under
`https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/*` (e.g.
`https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/internal`), per RFC 9457 (*Problem
Details for HTTP APIs*, which obsoletes RFC 7807). This replaces the bare
short-code convention (`INTERNAL`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, etc.) this spec
originally adopted to match `k8s-container-service-provider` and
`acm-cluster-service-provider`.

**Rationale:** this is a tracked, org-wide initiative, not a one-off ask —
Jira epic [FLPATH-4719](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4719)
("Align existing repositories to use RFC 9457 instead of the now obsolete
RFC 7807") was opened off audit
[FLPATH-4722](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4722), which found
both sibling SPs cited above still on RFC 7807. Migration tasks exist for
`k8s-container-service-provider`
([FLPATH-4720](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4720), in
progress), `acm-cluster-service-provider`
([FLPATH-4721](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/FLPATH-4721), in code
review as
[acm-cluster-service-provider#33](https://github.com/dcm-project/acm-cluster-service-provider/pull/33)),
and `control-plane` / `kubevirt-service-provider` /
`k8s-network-service-provider` / `cnpg-database-service-provider`
(FLPATH-4728..4731, not started). No OSAC SP-specific ticket exists yet, but
since this milestone hasn't merged, there's no reason to ship on the
now-superseded convention and immediately need a follow-up migration.

`acm-cluster-service-provider#33` (open, unmerged as of this decision) is
the concrete technical reference for the target shape:
`https://dcm-project.github.io/problems/{slug}` — a real, project-owned
GitHub Pages domain — replacing both this SP's bare-code convention and the
placeholder `dcm.example.com` domain ACM/k8s-container used as an
intermediate step (an IANA-reserved example domain per RFC 2606, never
project-controlled).

**Consequence:** this SP has no CRUD endpoints yet (Milestone 1), so the
blast radius is small — only `REQ-HTTP-070`/`AC-HTTP-070` (panic recovery)
reference a concrete `type` value today. Handlers reference the generated Go
constants (`v1alpha1.INTERNAL`, etc.) symbolically rather than the
underlying string literal, so only `api/v1alpha1/openapi.yaml`'s enum
values (and regenerated code) change — no handler logic changes.

**Related requirements:** REQ-HTTP-070

# Milestone 5 (Status Reporting) — pre-resolved recommendations

**Status: proposed, not yet ratified.** Milestone 5 has not started — no
spec exists yet, and per this repo's own spec-first/test-plan-first gate, no
`REQ-*`/`AC-*` or `TC-*` exist for it either. The two entries below
(`DD-200`–`DD-201`) are numbered in a block well clear of Milestone 3's
(`DD-080`..`DD-111`, on `feat/milestone-3-cluster-crud`, unmerged as of this
writing) and Milestone 4's (`DD-080`..`DD-086`, on
`feat/milestone-4-vm-crud`, unmerged as of this writing) independently-
numbered, not-yet-merged decisions, specifically to avoid a numbering
collision when those two branches eventually land. **Renumber into the
normal sequence (and drop "proposed" framing) once M5's spec formally
starts** — these are not a substitute for that gate.

Two further research findings (dependency versions to pin, and a
contract-test gap for the CloudEvents `data` payload) came out of the same
research pass but are implementation guidance, not durable architectural
decisions — they live in `.ai/exploration/m5-status-reporting-research.md`
(local-only) instead, for whoever writes M5's actual spec to verify against
current reality at that time.

## DD-200: NATS broker URL env var — recommend `DCM_NATS_URL`, not `SP_NATS_URL`

**Decision (proposed):** name the NATS broker URL config field
`DCM_NATS_URL` (a new field on the existing `DCMConfig` struct in
`internal/config/config.go`), not `SP_NATS_URL`.

**Rationale:** the two sibling SPs that already publish status disagree
with each other — `acm-cluster-service-provider` uses `SP_NATS_URL`,
`kubevirt-service-provider` uses bare `NATS_URL` — so this repo's own
established rule for `DCMConfig` ("match the sibling convention already
used for this backend," per `DCMConfig`'s doc comment and DD-050) doesn't
resolve cleanly by nose-count. Breaking the tie on that rule's underlying
*principle* instead: `DCMConfig` uses the unprefixed `DCM_` specifically
because `REGISTRATION_URL` names a DCM-wide, not-provider-specific backend
endpoint — every SP and `control-plane` must agree on the same URL. The
NATS broker is structurally identical (one shared, DCM-operated instance),
so it belongs on `DCMConfig` under the same reasoning, not on the
provider-specific `SP_` prefix.

**Related requirements:** none yet — M5 not started.

## DD-201: NATS publish transport — recommend JetStream (`js.Publish`), not core (`nc.Publish`)

**Decision (proposed):** publish status events via the JetStream API
(`js.Publish`), not plain core NATS (`nc.Publish`).

**Rationale:** `js.Publish` fails loudly (a retryable error) if the target
stream isn't ready yet; `nc.Publish` silently drops the message with no
error in that same case. This repo already has an established, documented
resilience convention for exactly this class of "dependency not ready yet"
condition (per the "Non-blocking bootstrap" and "Independent registration
loops" patterns in `CLAUDE.md`: the OIDC token loop, gRPC dial, and both
registration loops all retry indefinitely with backoff rather than
silently dropping work). Recommend `js.Publish` wrapped in the same kind of
indefinite-retry loop, matching `kubevirt-service-provider`'s transport
choice (not `acm-cluster-service-provider`'s) for consistency with this
repo's own convention, not that sibling's.

**Related requirements:** none yet — M5 not started.
